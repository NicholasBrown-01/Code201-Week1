                    <h2>Biography</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>I have served in the United States Air Force and United States Army for over 16 years. Deployed to 6 theaters of operation around the world, flown nearly 5,000 hours combined as a Flight Engineer and Pilot, and been awarded over 16 medals including: Air Medals, Aerial Achievement Medals, Air Force and Army Achievement Medals, and the Air Force Commendation Medal.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>None of these successes individually contribute or correlate to many civilian job opportunities. However, collectively they shape imperative skills and characteristics that any well-developed business oriented individual should have.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>I pride myself in knowing when to step-forward and lead whether in a static or dynamic environment; but more importantly when to step-back and listen to the experience and wisdom of those around me.</p>
